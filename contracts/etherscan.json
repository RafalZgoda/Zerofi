Chains are\n * identified by their alias, which is the same as the alias in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of\n * the `foundry.toml` file. For best UX, ensure the alias in the `foundry.toml` file match the\n * alias used in this contract, which can be found as the first argument to the\n * `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl` call in the `initializeStdChains` function.\n *\n * There are two main ways to use this contract:\n *   1. Set a chain with `setChain(string memory chainAlias, ChainData memory chain)` or\n *      `setChain(string memory chainAlias, Chain memory chain)`\n *   2. Get a chain with `getChain(string memory chainAlias)` or `getChain(uint256 chainId)`.\n *\n * The first time either of those are used, chains are initialized with the default set of RPC URLs.\n * This is done in `initializeStdChains`, which uses `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl`. Defaults are recorded in\n * `defaultRpcUrls`.\n *\n * The `setChain` function is straightforward, and it simply saves off the given chain data.\n *\n * The `getChain` methods use `getChainWithUpdatedRpcUrl` to return a chain. For example, let's say\n * we want to retrieve the RPC URL for `mainnet`:\n *   - If you have specified data with `setChain`, it will return that.\n *   - If you have configured a mainnet RPC URL in `foundry.toml`, it will return the URL, provided it\n *     is valid (e.g. a URL is specified, or an environment variable is given and exists).\n *   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the default data is returned.\n *\n * Summarizing the above, the prioritization hierarchy is `setChain` -> `foundry.toml` -> environment variable -> defaults.\n */\nabstract contract StdChains {\n    VmSafe private constant vm = VmSafe(address(uint160(uint256(keccak256(\"hevm cheat code\")))));\n\n    bool private stdChainsInitialized;\n\n    struct ChainData {\n        string name;\n        uint256 chainId;\n        string rpcUrl;\n    }\n\n    struct Chain {\n        // The chain name.\n        string name;\n        // The chain's Chain ID.\n        uint256 chainId;\n        // The chain's alias.

This contract extends\n * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n * contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n * with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n *\n * Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`\n * corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault\n * decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself\n * determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset\n * (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's\n * donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more\n * expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found\n * xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\n *\n * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\n * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\n * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\n * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\n * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\n *\n * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\n * ====\n *\n * _Available since v4.7._\n */\nabstract contract ERC4626 is ERC20, IERC4626 {\n    using Math for uint256;\n\n    IERC20 private immutable _asset;\n    uint8 private immutable _underlyingDecimals;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Set the underlying asset contract.
